# E06a-Bullets
Playing with bullet sprites:

It's narwhals vs. penguins(?)! These natural enemies are locked in a battle; who will survive?

This is the beginning of a shooter game. It will generate a bullet when the mouse button is clicked, and then detect a collision with a penguin , decrease its health, check if it dies, and increase the player's score accordingly. It will also quit the game when you defeat all the penguins.
